# Open Library
The project is a web tool that intends to help students who have difficulty finding open source book resources online. With an easy to use interface and simple yet effective design, this application will act as a center point where student can find the e-books as desired. This application will reduce the student's frustration of accessing books. Students will be able to save their favorite books and come back later to continue their chapters.
